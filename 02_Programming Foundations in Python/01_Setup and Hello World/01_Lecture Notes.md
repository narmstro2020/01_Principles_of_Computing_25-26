## 💻 Section 1: What is GitHub?

### 🌐 Definition
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that helps developers store and manage their code. It uses a system called **Git**, which tracks changes and versions of code files.

### 🧰 Why Use GitHub?
- Backup your code online
- Collaborate with others
- Keep version history
- Publish your projects

### 🗂️ Key Terms
| Term         | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Repository   | A project folder that holds your code |
| Commit       | A saved change to your code |
| Push         | Upload your commits to GitHub |
| Pull         | Download updates from GitHub |

## 🔧 Section 2: What is PyCharm?

### 🖥️ PyCharm is an IDE:
**IDE** = Integrated Development Environment  
It’s a tool that helps you write, test, and debug your code.

### 🧑‍💻 Why Use PyCharm?
- Color-coded syntax
- Auto-complete
- Built-in terminal
- Error highlighting

### 🪜 Setup Steps
1. Open PyCharm
2. Create New Project → name it `hello-world`
3. Choose Python interpreter (pre-installed)
4. Inside project folder, create new file `hello.py`

## 🧪 Section 3: Write Your First Python Program

### 🔤 Hello World Program
The simplest program in any language prints the words "Hello, world!" to the screen.

### ✅ Code:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

### 🧠 Explanation:
- `print()` is a function that displays output.
- Inside the parentheses, we give it a string in quotation marks.
- Python runs this line top-to-bottom and prints:  
  ```
  Hello, world!
  ```

### 🧪 Try Changing It:
```python
print("My name is Jordan!")
print("I love computing.")
```

## 🌍 Section 4: Connect PyCharm to GitHub

### 🧭 Steps:
1. Open the `hello-world` project in PyCharm
2. Click **VCS → Enable Version Control Integration → Git**
3. Right click project → Git → Add
4. Make your first commit
5. Link GitHub account
6. Push to GitHub

> Now your code is online! You can view it anytime at github.com/yourusername

## 🧑‍🎓 Class Activity

### Task 1: Write Your Program
Write a short Python program that prints your name and your favorite hobby.

```python

### Task 2: Push to GitHub
1. Commit your program
2. Push it to your GitHub repository
3. Submit the link via your LMS or classroom tool
