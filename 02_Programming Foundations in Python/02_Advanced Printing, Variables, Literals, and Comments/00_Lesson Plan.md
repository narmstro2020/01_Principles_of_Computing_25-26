## 🧠 R - Relevant Instruction (35 mins)

### 🔸 Variables (10 mins)
```python
name = "Jordan"
age = 16
height = 5.8
```
- Store data using names.

### 🔸 Literals (10 mins)
```python
"hello"       # string  
42            # integer  
3.14          # float  
True / False  # boolean
```

### 🔸 Comments (5 mins)
```python
# This is a comment
```
- Used to explain code.

### 🔸 Advanced Printing (10 mins)

#### Using commas
```python
print("Name:", name)
```

#### Concatenation
```python
print("Name: " + name)
```

#### f-strings
```python
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")
```
