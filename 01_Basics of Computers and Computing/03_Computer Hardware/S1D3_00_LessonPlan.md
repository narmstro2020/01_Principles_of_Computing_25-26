## 🔵 W - Welcome (5 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Greet students by name.
- Display the warm-up:  
  > _“If you could upgrade one part of your computer (or phone), what would it be?”_
- Take attendance as students respond.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Share their answer aloud or on paper.  
- Begin thinking about how devices are built.

**Differentiation:**  
- Provide examples: “More RAM,” “Faster processor,” “Better battery.”

---

## 🎯 A - Aim (3 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Post and read aloud today’s objective:  
  > _“By the end of class, students will be able to describe how computers are organized, identify common hardware components, and explain their functions.”_

**Students’ Role:**  
- Listen and track today’s goals.

---

## 🔁 R - Review (5 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Ask: “What does a computer need to process data?”
- Allow students to call out: CPU, memory, etc.
- Recap **input → process → output**.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Respond with Day 02 knowledge.  
- Prepare for deeper dive into physical parts.

---

## 🧠 R - Relevant Instruction (35 mins)

### Activity 1: How Computers are Organized (10 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Present the Von Neumann architecture (briefly).  
  - Input → CPU (control unit + ALU) → Memory → Output  
- Use a block diagram to illustrate.

### Activity 2: Overview of Hardware (15 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Describe key hardware types:
  - Input devices: keyboard, mouse, camera  
  - Output devices: screen, speakers, printer  
  - Processing: CPU, GPU  
  - Storage: SSD, HDD  
  - Memory: RAM vs. ROM  
  - Motherboard, power supply, cooling

### Activity 3: Real-World Device Examples (10 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Show teardown images or videos (e.g., inside a desktop or phone).
- Label each part live on screen with discussion.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Take notes with a guided worksheet.  
- Ask clarifying questions.

**Differentiation:**  
- Offer labeled diagram handout.  
- Use icons or visuals for each part.

---

## 🧩 I - Interactive (18 mins)

**Activity: Hardware Matching Game**

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Hand out shuffled cards (or slides) of **device names** and **functions**.
- Guide students to match and explain:
  - Ex: "CPU" ⇔ "Processes instructions"
- Offer an online drag-and-drop version as alternative.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Work in pairs to match hardware to purpose.
- Share matches during discussion.

**Differentiation:**  
- Provide picture clues.
- Use group work to scaffold understanding.

---

## 🟢 O - Ownership (10 mins)

**Activity: Draw and Label a Computer**

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Ask students to draw either:
  - A desktop computer setup  
  - Or their phone internals  
- Label at least 6 components.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Use notes to complete a labeled diagram.  
- May add icons, arrows, or descriptions.

**Differentiation:**  
- Provide templates with blanks.  
- Allow students to use digital tools.

---

## 🔔 R - Resonate (10 mins)

**Exit Ticket Prompts:**
1. Name 2 input and 2 output devices.
2. What is the CPU responsible for?
3. One part you’d like to upgrade and why.

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Collect or discuss answers aloud.
- Reinforce student confidence in recognizing hardware.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Complete the ticket.  
- Share aloud if prompted.

**Differentiation:**  
- Use sentence starters or a multiple-choice version.
