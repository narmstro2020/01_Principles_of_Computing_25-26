## 🔵 W - Welcome (5 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Greet students at the door.
- Display this warm-up:  
  > _“What’s one app you use every day?”_  
  > _“Is it installed on your device or does it work online (cloud)?”_
- Take attendance as students share answers aloud or in writing.

**Students’ Role:**  
- Respond and reflect on software/cloud use in their life.

**Differentiation:**  
- Provide examples: Google Docs, TikTok, Spotify, Gmail.

---

## 🎯 A - Aim (3 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Display and read:  
  > _“By the end of today’s lesson, students will be able to describe the role of an operating system, distinguish between system software and application software, explain the concept of cloud computing, and identify basic concepts behind modern AI models like LLMs.”_

**Students’ Role:**  
- Track today’s learning targets in notebooks or visually.

---

## 🔁 R - Review (5 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Ask questions like:  
  - “What hardware does your computer need to run?”  
  - “What’s the job of the CPU?”  
  - “How do input/output devices work together?”

**Students’ Role:**  
- Respond verbally or via quick poll or warm-up board.

**Differentiation:**  
- Use sentence starters: “The CPU...”, “An input device is...”

---

## 🧠 R - Relevant Instruction (35 mins)

### Activity 1: What is an Operating System? (10 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Explain that the **OS** manages hardware and software.
- Show examples: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android.
- Display diagram of OS interacting with hardware & apps.

### Activity 2: Software vs Applications (10 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Define and differentiate:
  - **System Software**: OS, drivers, utilities
  - **Application Software**: Word processors, games, browsers
- Give examples: Notepad, Chrome, Minecraft, Zoom

**Students’ Role:**  
- Record definitions + examples in guided notes.

### Activity 3: Cloud Computing (7 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Explain cloud vs local storage
- Use analogies: local = backpack; cloud = school locker
- Show real examples: Google Drive, Dropbox, Netflix

### Activity 4: Intro to AI + LLMs (8 mins)

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Ask: “Have you heard of ChatGPT, Siri, or Alexa?”
- Define **AI** as machine decision-making.
- Define **LLM** as AI that understands/generates language.
- Show simple text-to-text demo or animation

**Students’ Role:**  
- Watch + ask questions about how AI relates to apps they use.

---

## 🧩 I - Interactive (18 mins)

### Activity: App Sort + OS Match + AI Demo

**Task 1: App Sort (5 mins)**  
- Students categorize apps into “system software” or “application software.”

**Task 2: OS Match (5 mins)**  
- Students match devices to correct OS.

**Task 3: AI Interaction (8 mins)**  
- Group or live demo: students ask AI a question and analyze the response.
- Teacher facilitates discussion: “How does it know what to say?”

**Differentiation:**  
- Use icons and images for software.
- Partner work or sentence scaffolds.

---

## 🟢 O - Ownership (10 mins)

### Activity: Diagram – You and the Tech Stack

**Students create a diagram** showing:
- Their device
- The OS
- The apps
- Cloud services (like Google Docs or iCloud)
- Optional: Where AI might be helping in the background

**Format:** Paper, Jamboard, Slides, or handout

**Differentiation:**  
- Provide pre-labeled graphic organizer
- Allow short paragraph instead of drawing

---

## 🔔 R - Resonate (10 mins)

### Exit Ticket Prompts:
1. What is one thing your OS does that you didn’t know before?
2. What’s one app you now realize depends on the cloud?
3. How does AI relate to the apps you use?

**Teacher’s Role:**  
- Collect or discuss answers.
- Optional: Group reflection circle or “one word takeaway.”

**Differentiation:**  
- Use scaffolded ticket with checkboxes or sentence starters

## 🧰 Supplies

- Slide deck with OS/software/cloud diagrams  
- Device + OS matching cards  
- App categorization handout  
- Exit tickets  
- Optional: AI demo slide or script
