# Structured Lecture Script - Day 02: Introduction to Computing Concepts

## 🎤 Part 1: A Brief History of Computers (15–20 mins)

### Slide 1: The Origins of Counting
- Begin with the **Abacus (~2400 BCE)**: Used in Mesopotamia and China for early arithmetic.
- Introduce **mechanical calculators** like the **Pascaline** and **Leibniz's Stepped Reckoner**.

### Slide 2: Early Computing Visionaries
- **Charles Babbage (1837)**: The Analytical Engine – first mechanical general-purpose computer.
- **Ada Lovelace**: First to write an algorithm, envisioned machines that could do more than math.

### Slide 3: First Modern Computers
- **ENIAC (1945)**: Giant machine used for artillery calculations.
- **UNIVAC I (1951)**: First commercial computer used in business and media.

### Slide 4: Personal Computing
- **IBM PC (1981)** standardized computing for offices and schools.
- **Apple I and II (1976–77)** pioneered the idea of computers in the home.

### Slide 5: The Internet and Mobile Era
- **World Wide Web (1989)**: Tim Berners-Lee connects the world with information.
- **iPhone (2007)**: Merges computing with mobile life; app revolution.

### Slide 6: The Future Begins Now
- **Cloud computing** allows apps and data to live online.
- **AI tools** (ChatGPT, Copilot) automate and extend human creativity.

## 🧩 Part 3: What is Software? (5 mins)

### Slide 9: Software vs Hardware
- **Hardware** = physical (keyboard, CPU, RAM)
- **Software** = programs, apps, websites

### Slide 10: Types of Software
- **System Software**: Operating systems, device drivers.
- **Application Software**: Browsers, games, spreadsheets.
- **Middleware**: Connects multiple systems.

## 👨‍💻 Part 4: What is Software Development? (10–12 mins)

### Slide 11: What Developers Do
- Software developers write instructions (code) for computers to follow.

### Slide 12: Development Tools
- IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse.
- Version Control: Git, GitHub.
- Build Tools: npm, Maven.

### Slide 13: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. Requirements gathering  
2. Design  
3. Implementation (coding)  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  
6. Maintenance

### Slide 14: Collaboration & Ethics
- Teams: devs, designers, testers, managers.
- Agile methods = fast collaboration.
- Ethics: privacy, fairness, inclusivity, AI bias.
